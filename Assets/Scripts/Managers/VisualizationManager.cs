/// Placement strategy: Candidate K with Density-Adaptive Overlap Resolution
/// and Density-Adaptive Scaling.
///
/// Candidate K (global anchor + per-planet affine scaling):
/// - Planets are placed at their raw UMAP positions × positionScale.
/// - All children and images within a planet are positioned relative to
///   the planet's world position using their UMAP offset × effectivePlanetScale.
/// - Each planet's effectivePlanetScale is derived from its local density
///   context: isolated planets get the full base planetScale, while planets
///   in dense clusters get a reduced scale to minimize cross-planet
///   image cloud overlap.
/// - Within each planet the transformation is still a uniform affine,
///   so all within-planet distance ratios are preserved exactly.
///
/// Density-Adaptive Overlap Resolution:
/// - At each hierarchy level where local density causes radius-vs-spacing
///   mismatch, visual sphere radii are capped based on nearest-neighbour
///   spacing (sibling radius capping).
/// - At the top level, if residual overlap remains after capping, a minimal
///   position separation pass pushes overlapping planets apart while
///   preserving local neighbourhood topology.
/// - This resolution is data-driven: it is a no-op for sparse configurations
///   (e.g., 4 planets) and activates automatically for denser ones (e.g., 47).
///
/// - Clicking a node toggles expansion: reveals/hides its direct children.
/// - Collapsing is recursive: all expanded descendants are also collapsed.
